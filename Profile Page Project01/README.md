        <span>The </span><strong><span>Laptop</span></strong><span> object is the most important part of this page. I made a login animation and a </span><strong><span>Tiny Functional Terminal</span></strong>

    <p>
        <span>This is my </span><strong><span>first</span></strong>
        <span> front-end project ! I got the main design idea when I was sleeping . As a beginner to HTML , CSS , Javascript , it’s truly a tough experience . For all the Code , I guarantee that </span>

        <span>Inspiration</span>
        <span>
            After I saw some examples of cool parallax 3D websites .I got the inspiration of making a font website like my room :and add some cool stuff on the Laptop object ,like login animation and a small terminal for visitors to browse
            around.

    <h2 id="HTML" data-id="HTML"><span>HTML</span></h2>
    <p><span>As you can see most of my objects are wrapped in div (90% of my tagName are div …) , l don’t have enough acknowledgements of front-end so making all objects using div is my only solution.</span></p>
    <h2 id="CSS" data-id="CSS"><span>CSS</span></h2>
    <p>
        <span>I haven’t made any css animation before , but </span><ins><span>I didn’t copy others’ animation and continue on the project</span></ins>
        <span>
            , instead I learn the animation concept and change some properties and remake on my own. For instance , the main concept of wave animation is moving the different levels of wave wrapper left and right and also changing the Y
            position and the scale ( ScaleY , translateX , translateY ;btw,I set different levels with multi-duration ) .

    <h2 id="Javascript" data-id="Javascript"><span>Javascript</span></h2>
    <p>
        <span>
            querySelector , getElementById etc.They are all new concepts for me( I used to program about competitive programming or algorithms. ) Making a fake terminal that work with UI is not easy at all . Fortunately , StackOverFlow can
            solve most of my bugs .
